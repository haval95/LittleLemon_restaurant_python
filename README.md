# LittleLemon Restaurant - Python Practice Project

Welcome to the **LittleLemon** restaurant project! This project serves as a practical exercise in Python development, focused on creating a reservation system and menu viewer for a restaurant.

## Description

The **LittleLemon** project is designed to simulate the functionality of a restaurant reservation system and menu viewer. Users can utilize this application to reserve tables and explore the available menu items. It provides a convenient interface for customers to book tables and view the restaurant's menu offerings.

This project aims to showcase Python programming skills and demonstrate proficiency in developing web applications. By implementing core features such as table reservation management and menu presentation, it provides an opportunity to gain practical experience in various aspects of web development, including Django framework, database management, and user interface design.

## Features

- **Table Reservation**: Users can browse available tables, check their availability, and make table reservations for specific dates and times.
- **Menu Viewer**: The application allows users to explore the restaurant's menu, view details of individual dishes, and make informed choices based on the available options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for customers when reserving tables or browsing the menu.
- **Practice Project**: LittleLemon is primarily developed as a Python practice project, allowing developers to enhance their Python skills and gain hands-on experience with web development concepts.
